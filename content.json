    "content": "Also, my experience of Samsung TVs (I have a 2019 55 Q80R) is that unlike LG, support for older sets is limited. For example, to the best of my knowledge the Q90 series from 2019 are still waiting for their eARC update (inexplicably absent in the first place in 2019) and the app support is not as strong. Case in point, Disney+ and Apple TV apps not supporting Dolby Atmos output, despite having a compatible soundbar attached. LG seem to really push the boat out on ensuring support for the latest formats and codecs. Not to mention Dolby Vision, which is becoming a must, with the rich availability of streaming content in this format. For that reason, I won't buy a Samsung TV again.LG 55E6V OLED, Panasonic BDP-UB820, ATV 4KKEF 3005SE + Dali Alteco (5.1.4), Denon AVR-X4500H"

You would think that Samsung would be all over that given most of their TV business is pure marketing.The amount of people under the illusion that Dolby Vision is a must have feature is quite sad really but great marketing I guess from Dolby - people see their name next to it and think they are getting something special."

Yes, the graph looks out, which it is in the brightest part of the scale, but you would be hard-pressed to see any visible errors with actual content in the Movie Mode with that result. If you read the review that is quite obviously stated.

You need to understand that what is being pointed it is something that the vast majority of viewers will not see in actual viewing. But it is mentioned to be complete. I'm all for people having opposing opinions, but they should at least make a point of seeing the product in action first, rather than looking at a graph and assuming it is a disaster. You also need to look at the scale of the graph to see that what we are sometimes talking about are single figure percentages. The greyscale accuracy is not the biggest issue with this TV either, you'll find those pointed out in the review as well, but they are balanced against what is very good. Once I have a good understanding of the good and the bad I give a verdict based on that, in this case, it has some real plus points that would give it a recommendation.AVForums EditorISF and THX Certified AV CalibratorFollow me on Twitter!-My personal opinions are not those of AVForums or any other related website."
